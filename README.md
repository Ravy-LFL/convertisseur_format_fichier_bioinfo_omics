# README Project : Convert omics files in differents formats.

Those scripts was write during my 1st semester of my 1st year of master.

This folder contains differents scripts used to convert a format to another. The name of the script indicate the converts.
Each file can be used independently but also can be call as a library, as it is done by `FormatTools.py`.

The easiest way to use the conversion files is to use `FormatTools.py` which call `FormatLibrairie.py` containing each necessiry tools.

## Usage :

`python3 FormatTools.py convert input output`

Note than the single tools can be used as follow : `python3 script.py input output`
